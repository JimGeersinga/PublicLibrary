Restore nuget packages before starting the app.

I haven't added a librarian is it is not needed to have a working app.

"A user manual detailing the functions of the system, both for customers and for the librarian, and how to call them, with examples"
This is a WPF application which has a graphical user interface. So there's not explanation needed to use the app.
